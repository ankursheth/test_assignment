# Question 2:

Q. copy all files in a directory older than 1 week to another directory

--> find /home/mike/Downloads/ -maxdepth 1 -mtime +7 -type f -exec mv {} /home/mike/test_bak/ \;

where /home/mike/Downloads is Source directory and /home/mike/test_bak is the Destination directory.


Q. given a directory of files, appends the timestamp of when the file was created to the files name

--> touch testfile_$(date -d "today" +"%Y%m%d%H%M").txt

Actually, this is just the way how I can append the timestamp to the filename when it gets created, I found it difficult to find the way to attach the past timestamps of when the files were created in Linux environment.
